    "# In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. \n",
    "# As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, \n",
    "# ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. \n",
    "# Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. \n",
    "# Your script will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.\n",
    "# * Assess the passage for each of the following:\n",
    "#  * Approximate word count\n",
    "#  * Approximate sentence count\n",
    "#  * Approximate letter count (per word)\n",
    "#  * Average sentence length (in words)\n",
    "\n",
    "# * As an example, this passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "# “Adam Wayne, the conqueror, with his face flung back and his mane like a lion's, \n",
    "# stood with his great sword point upwards, the red raiment of his office flapping around him \n",
    "# like the red wings of an archangel. And the King saw, he knew not how, something new and overwhelming. \n",
    "# The great green trees and the great red robes swung together in the wind. The preposterous masquerade, \n",
    "# born of his own mockery, towered over him and embraced the world. This was the normal, this was sanity, \n",
    "# this was nature, and he himself, with his rationality, and his detachment and his black frock-coat, \n",
    "# he was the exception and the accident a blot of black upon a world of crimson and gold.”\n",
    "\n",
    "# ...would yield these results:\n",
